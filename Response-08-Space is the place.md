Sun Ra was an eye opening movie! I like the lofi usage of stage props and lighting effects to give a sense of 3-dimensionality to the movie. 2 Figures battling in a card game with the futures of the Black Diaspora as the stakes. Recurring characters all had a sense of agency between Sun-Ra and his adversaries. I liked the idea of Afro futurism is not dependant on the socialized view of Blacks normalized by colonial rule. They had to leave their "blackness" behind in order to reinvent themselves in space. 
Coming to terms with the darker parts of African American culture and choosing self enlightenment over the worldly desires, seemed to be a recurring theme. Drugs, women, and status did nothing for the soul. Sun- Ra's philosophy triumphed over the agents, drug lords, pimps and illicit vices. 


The movie still stands up in the modern era.The acting in this movie was stellar and the comedic references and the usage The use of the N word helped to unravel and portray the social power structure of the characters in relation to the Black actors on film. Beyond Green states that social practice is the best way to critique and understand a postion. Space is the Place is a work that reflects sustainabilty and reformation of the Earth through the themes of the movie. I would consider the film an "Earthwork" by the standards of Beyond the Green.
